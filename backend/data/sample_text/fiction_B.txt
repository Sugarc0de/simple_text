It was the last day of school and the terror of the previous weeks had crept up on me again. My classmates were already gathering in the Assembly Room for what we jokingly called the Last Rites, and I had run upstairs to the dormitory for my journal, forgotten under my pillow in the excitement of the Last Day.

I was only just in time. The domestic robots were already busy stripping the beds, bundling up the sheets for the laundry, and folding the blankets into neat rectangles, each topped by a pillow, to be placed on the mattresses. I rescued my journal from the robot's claw and stood with it tight against my chest, staring out of the window, trying to control my shivers.

The Government School, which had been my home for the last ten years, had been built three hundred years before in what would later become part of a national forest. From the dormitory window I could see softly rolling hills, the morning mist caught in their folds, and a small grove through which ran the road connecting the school with the main highway, out of sight somewhere beyond the trees and the mist.

A small procession of electric buses appeared from among the trees and scrunched up the gravel road to park in front of the main entrance. At the sight of them panic gripped me. My mouth was dry and my stomach churned. Within the next few hours I would be aboard one of those buses, heading off into the unknown, to some place where I would have to spend the rest of my life doing. . .doing what? I pressed my head against the cold glass and longed to be someone else, somewhere else, sometime else...
