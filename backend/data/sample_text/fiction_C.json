{"genre": "fiction", "level": "C", "text": "Mr. L. Prosser was, as they say, only human. In other words he was a carbon-based bipedal life form descended from an ape. More specifically he was forty, fat and shabby and worked for the local council. Curiously enough, though he didn\u2019t know it, he was also a direct male-line descendant of Genghis Khan, though intervening generations and racial mixing had so juggled his genes that he had no discernible Mongoloid characteristics, and the only vestiges left in Mr. L. Prosser of his mighty ancestry were a pronounced stoutness about the tum and a predilection for little fur hats.\n\nHe was by no means a great warrior; in fact he was a nervous, worried man. Today he was particularly nervous and worried because something had gone seriously wrong with his job, which was to see that Arthur Dent\u2019s house got cleared out of the way before the day was out.\n\n\u201cCome off it, Mr. Dent,\u201d he said, \u201cyou can\u2019t win, you know. You can\u2019t lie in front of the bulldozer indefinitely.\u201d He tried to make his eyes blaze fiercely but they just wouldn\u2019t do it.\n\nArthur lay in the mud and squelched at him.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m game,\u201d he said, \u201cwe\u2019ll see who rusts first.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid you\u2019re going to have to accept it,\u201d said Mr. Prosser, gripping his fur hat and rolling it round the top of his head; \u201cthis bypass has got to be built and it\u2019s going to be built!\u201d\n"}
